**Title:** ‚ÄúPerformance Impact of NIST PQC Signature Schemes (Dilithium vs. Falcon) on Transaction Processing in a Simulated Resource-Constrained Blockchain Node‚Äù

## What I Want to Explore:
Many papers test PQC signature schemes in ideal environments or simply plug them into a blockchain. But I'm more curious about how they behave in a constrained environment‚Äîthink lightweight clients or IoT-type devices that might join a blockchain network in the future.

I‚Äôm planning to:

*   Simulate a minimal blockchain node (doesn‚Äôt need networking) that just reads transactions, verifies signatures, and measures latency and resource usage.
*   Compare Dilithium and Falcon, across multiple security levels (not just the common Level 2 or 3).
*   Record not just the average transaction-per-second rate, but also latency distribution, looking for performance spikes or outliers that might appear with PQC but not with ECDSA.
*   Measure CPU usage and memory footprint to see what kind of resource strain these algorithms introduce, especially at higher security levels.

## Conclusion
If blockchains start running on smaller or embedded devices, it‚Äôs important to know how heavy PQC schemes are in practice. This could expose some performance bottlenecks or trade-offs between Dilithium and Falcon in constrained environments, which I haven‚Äôt seen much work on.

## Feasibility:
*   I can use liboqs, which has solid C and Python bindings for these algorithms.
*   I‚Äôll simulate the node's transaction validation loop and collect metrics using tools like `time`, `memory_profiler`, or Python's `tracemalloc`.
