**Thesis Idea: Blockchain-Based Tracking and Transparency for Zakat/Sadaqah Distribution by Registered NGOs in Bangladesh.**

**1. Problem Statement & Motivation:**

*   **Context:** Zakat (obligatory charity) and Sadaqah (voluntary charity) are fundamental pillars of Islam, widely practiced in Bangladesh. A significant amount of these funds flows through Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and charitable foundations dedicated to collecting and distributing them.
*   **Challenge:** Donors, while trusting, often lack clear visibility into how their specific contributions are utilized and whether they reach the intended beneficiaries or projects according to Shariah guidelines (for Zakat). This can sometimes lead to:
    *   Reduced donor confidence.
    *   Concerns about administrative overhead or misdirection of funds.
    *   Difficulty for NGOs to demonstrably prove their impact and efficient use of funds.
*   **Opportunity:** Blockchain technology, with its inherent properties of transparency, immutability, and traceability, can offer a mechanism to enhance trust and accountability in this process without necessarily compromising the privacy of individual beneficiaries.

**2. Proposed Solution & Scope:**

The thesis would propose and develop a proof-of-concept system where:

*   **Registered NGOs:** Recognized NGOs (e.g., those registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau of Bangladesh or other relevant bodies) are the primary actors managing funds on the system.
*   **Donations:**
    *   Donors contribute Zakat/Sadaqah to an NGO.
    *   The NGO records the *inflow* of these funds onto the blockchain.
        *   **Privacy:** Individual donor identities might be kept off-chain by the NGO for their internal records. On-chain, donations could be represented by a transaction linked to the NGO's wallet, perhaps with a type (Zakat/Sadaqah) and a unique (but anonymized) donation ID or batch ID.
        *   **Aggregation:** NGOs might aggregate smaller donations into batches before recording them on-chain to reduce transaction costs/complexity.
*   **Fund Pooling & Allocation (Conceptual):**
    *   The NGO designates on-chain "pools" or "projects" for different categories of Zakat-eligible expenses (e.g., Food for the Needy, Education for Orphans, Healthcare for Indigents) or Sadaqah projects.
    *   Smart contracts could (conceptually) manage the allocation of incoming funds to these pools based on NGO decisions.
*   **Distribution & Spending:**
    *   When the NGO distributes funds or resources, it records these *outflows* on the blockchain.
    *   **Traceability:** Each outflow transaction would be linked to:
        *   The source pool/project.
        *   The type of expenditure (e.g., "Purchase of 100kg Rice," "Payment for School Fees for 10 Children," "Medical Camp Expenses").
        *   A generalized beneficiary category or location (e.g., "Distributed in Kurigram flood relief," "Support to an orphanage in Dhaka"). **Crucially, individual beneficiary PII (Personally Identifiable Information) should NOT be stored on a public blockchain.** Anonymized IDs or aggregate data is key.
        *   Evidence (optional): A hash of supporting documents (e.g., receipts, distribution lists â€“ the documents themselves stored off-chain, perhaps on IPFS, accessible only to auditors/NGO).
*   **Transparency Portal:**
    *   A simple web interface (DApp) allowing the public (and donors) to:
        *   View total funds received by participating NGOs (categorized by Zakat/Sadaqah if possible).
        *   Track how funds are allocated to different projects/pools.
        *   See records of distributions and expenditures linked to these projects.
        *   View aggregated impact metrics (e.g., "X Taka spent on food aid this month").

**3. Key Features & Uniqueness Aspects:**

*   **Focus on Zakat/Sadaqah Rules:** The system design should acknowledge (at least conceptually) the specific Shariah requirements for Zakat eligibility and distribution categories. This differentiates it from generic charity tracking.
*   **NGO-Centric Model:** Designed for adoption by existing, registered NGOs in Bangladesh, rather than trying to disintermediate them entirely.
*   **Balanced Transparency & Privacy:** Publicly verifiable fund flow without compromising individual beneficiary or donor privacy on-chain.
*   **Auditability:** Creates an immutable audit trail for NGOs to demonstrate compliance and impact to regulators or auditors.
*   **Tailored to Bangladeshi Context:** Considers the types of NGOs, common charitable activities, and potential for simple user interfaces.

**4. Technical Feasibility for an Undergrad Thesis:**

This is **achievable** as an undergrad thesis with a focused scope:

*   **Blockchain Choice:**
    *   **Permissioned (Recommended for PoC):** Hyperledger Fabric is a good choice. Can set up a basic network with 2-3 organizations (e.g., two NGOs, one conceptual "Regulator/Auditor" org). This allows more control over who participates. **(No direct collaboration is also feasable as we can move based on our understanding of NGO operations and Zakat/Sadaqah processes on publicly available information, research papers, articles, and general knowledge.)**

    *   **Public Testnet (Alternative):** Ethereum testnets (like Sepolia) can be used. Simpler to get started with smart contracts (Solidity), but you'll need to manage test ETH.
*   **Smart Contracts (Chaincode in Fabric / Solidity in Ethereum):**
    *   Functions to:
        *   Register an NGO.
        *   Record donation inflow (<code>recordDonation(ngoID, amount, type, donationBatchID)</code>).
        *   Create/manage project pools (<code>createProject(ngoID, projectName, projectType)</code>).
        *   Allocate funds to projects (<code>allocateToProject(ngoID, donationBatchID, projectID, amount)</code>).
        *   Record distribution/expenditure (<code>recordDistribution(ngoID, projectID, expenseType, amountSpent, beneficiaryCategory, evidenceHash)</code>).
        *   Query functions to retrieve data for the transparency portal.
*   **Off-Chain Components:**
    *   Simple web interface (React, Vue, or even basic HTML/JS) to interact with the smart contracts (using libraries like `ethers.js` for Ethereum or Fabric SDKs).
    *   Simulate NGO actions (data entry).
    *   No need for real payment integration.
*   **Data Model:** Clearly define the structure of data stored on-chain and any off-chain references.
*   **IPFS (Optional but good):** For storing hashes of "evidence" documents. Integration is straightforward.
*   **Focus:** The core is the smart contract logic and the data flow for transparency. The UI can be very basic.

**5. What Makes it "Unique" and "Never Done Before" (Potentially):**

*   **Specificity to Zakat/Sadaqah in Bangladesh:** While blockchain for charity is a known concept, the detailed application to the Zakat/Sadaqah ecosystem *within the Bangladeshi NGO context*, considering local practices and regulatory environments, is likely underexplored in depth at an academic (especially undergrad) level.
*   **Practical NGO-Centric Design:** Many blockchain solutions are purely theoretical or aim for full disintermediation. Focusing on a tool that *existing, registered NGOs* could realistically adopt (even if simplified in the PoC) offers a practical angle.
*   **Emphasis on Shariah-Compliance Aspects (Conceptual):** Even if we don't implement complex Shariah validation in smart contracts (which would be very hard), *designing the data model and fund flow with Zakat categories in mind* adds a layer of uniqueness.
*   **Contribution:** Your thesis could provide a foundational model and proof-of-concept that sparks further research or even pilot projects in Bangladesh.

**6. Steps to Implement:**

1.  **Detailed Literature Review:** Understand existing blockchain-for-charity solutions, Zakat management systems (traditional and tech-based), and the Bangladeshi NGO landscape. Identify gaps.
2.  **System Design:**
    *   Define actors (NGOs, Donors (abstracted), Public/Auditors).
    *   Define data to be stored on-chain vs. off-chain.
    *   Design smart contract functions and state variables.
    *   Sketch out the user interface for the transparency portal.
3.  **Setup Blockchain Environment:** Choose and set up Hyperledger Fabric or an Ethereum testnet.
4.  **Develop Smart Contracts:** Write, test, and deploy your chaincode/Solidity contracts.
5.  **Develop Basic Frontend:** Create a simple web interface to call smart contract functions and display data.
6.  **Simulate Scenarios:**
    *   NGO registers.
    *   Donations are recorded.
    *   Funds are allocated to (simulated) Zakat-compliant projects.
    *   Distributions are recorded with (hashed) evidence.
    *   Show how the transparency portal reflects these actions.
7.  **Analysis & Discussion:**
    *   Discuss the benefits (transparency, auditability).
    *   Analyze the limitations of your PoC (scalability, real-world complexities, privacy of beneficiaries if not handled carefully).
    *   Discuss security considerations.
    *   Suggest future work and potential for real-world adoption.
8.  **Write Thesis Document:** Structure it with introduction, literature review, methodology, system design, implementation, results, discussion, and conclusion.
